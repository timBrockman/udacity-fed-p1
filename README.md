### project 1 in udacity front-end nano-degree
The objective is to turn the mockup .pdf into html/css.
Initially, I want to match the mockup as close as possible. After achieving a passing version I'll create a more interesting branch. As personal side objectives, I plan to create and use a simple grunt workflow, use vim a bit more, and make clearer single idea commits. When working alone I often slack on these things.
